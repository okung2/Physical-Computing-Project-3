# Rain Notifying Umbrella

This repository contains the source code and DXF files to
replicate an umbrella that lights up when it is going to rain.

# Goal

This project was made for the second assignment for Physical
Computing Studio. The goal was to create an umbrella that lights
up when it is raining. The umbrella handle would be the
part that illuminates when it is raining.

# Process

I started the process by using an API from Wunderground to obtain
the current precipitation today in inches. Then I purchased an
umbrella and cut off the handle of purchased umbrella. From the
cut off handle, I modeled a similar handle to cut out using the
laser cutter. I then cut out the umbrella handle, stacked and glued
the sheets of acrylic together. Then I wrote the code and wired up
the Raspberry Pi. I decided on making 3 sets of 3 LEDs that
illuminate based on the amount of precipitation that is falling
from the sky.

# List of Parts
    - 6 cut acrylic parts
    - 1 Raspberry Pi
    - 1 umbrella minus the handle
    - 9 LEDs
    - External power source
    - Resistors
    - 3 Transistors
